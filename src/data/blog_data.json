		"body": "It took 8,623 days, 2,026 games, and 200,560 points for the Toronto Raptors to rise to the top of the NBA. The way this team ignited the nation, it feels like the celebration might run just as long.When the Raptors defeated the Golden State Warriors in Game 6 of the NBA Finals Thursday night, they wrote the franchise’s name into the league’s history books and ushered in a new era of basketball up north, bringing the championship to Canada for the first time in history.",
		"conclusion": "It certainly wasn’t an easy journey to the Finals — the Raptors were down, but never out. In fact, Toronto is the the first team in league history to win the title after trailing in each series leading up to the FinalsThey started down 1-0 to the Magic in Round 1 before winning four straight, were down 2-1 to the 76ers in the second round before taking it to seven games, and dug themselves out of a 2-0 hole with four straight wins to beat the Bucks in the Eastern Conference Final.They also conquered both No. 1 seeds (Milwaukee and Golden State) enroute to the title, making them the sixth team to in NBA history to do so.",
